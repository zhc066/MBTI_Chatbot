    "\n",
    "Hi there! Welcome to my COGS 18 final project, look at that, that is right! I made a mini MBTI chatbot. Never heard of MBTI? \n",
    "No probem. The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a pseudoscientific, self-report questionnaire that claims to indicate differing \"psychological types\" (often commonly called \"personality types\"). Basically, the MBTi test tells what kind of person you are. Sounds pretty interesting right? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 16 personality accroding to the MBTI test, I am ENFJ, so I am a protagnoist feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic. Yes, that is exactly who am I. Who MBTI type you are? I am really curious, why not find out below? I inserted a link here so when you get the result you can look up your corresponding personality type.

    "The difficulties I encountered in this project mainly focus on the pytest part, at first, after I write those unit test, and the test functioins, I could not figure out how to execute them. After I figured out how to execute them, I encountered the problems such as wrong assertion, MUST USE pytest -s to run the test due to the fact one of the my test functions requires stirng input. The other problem I encounterd is that I have to find outside sources when I doing the test_end_chat, in class, we did not learn how to capture the string outputs, so I looked up online, and figure out StringIO().getvalue() can capture the whole output content. But I failed at the Pytest, then I figured out a with statement can bind with the new created StringIO object, so the actuial output and expected one will stay consistent and pass the test. One thing worths to be notice is that my testcells have to use pytest -s to pass, or it will fail because the assertion test requires an input for test_ask_question. I appreciate the effort of myself. More important, I would like to thank Professor, and the wonderful TAs, you guys are the real one."
